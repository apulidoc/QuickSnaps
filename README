HOW TO INSTALL
===============

- Unzip and upload (or vice-versa should you be that way inclined)

- Make sure the 'uploads' directory is writeable

- Make sure the 'quicksnaps_app/config' directory is writeable (you can change back after install)

- Point your browser to where you have installed QuickSnaps and set up database and admin account


- Enjoy!
